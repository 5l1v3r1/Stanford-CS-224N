# Stanford-CS-224N
Programming notes and examples done based on the assignments of the Stanford CS 224N course.

I took all of the assignments and turned them into Jupyter Notebooks.  Review the Blank Notebooks folder to see the new Notebooks created for this course (currently feeturing Homework 2 from 2020).  As the first assignment is already a Jupyter Notebook, I will not be storing a copy of it in this folder.
